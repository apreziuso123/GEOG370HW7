<h1>Antonio Preziuso Homework 7 </h1>
<h2>For this homework I created a chloropleth map of the United States. This map depicts which states had the highest VEP (Voter Eligible Population) turnout during the November 2020 General Election. The ratio this map uses is VEP for each state divided by that states total population. This ratio was used to remove the issue of states with more people having the appearance of a higher turnout. Furthermore, I used Pretty Breaks as the classification mode for this chloropleth map in order to create percent ranges for each class that are easier to understand. </h2>
